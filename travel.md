Located near the fifth busiest airport in the world; the intersection of the Tri-State Tollway (I-294) and Jane Adams Memorial Tollway (I-90); and within region's extensive public transportation network, our venue should be accessible for all vistors.

Midway is a Southwest Airlines hub about 30-40 minutes south of the venue, while O'Hare is much bigger airport very close to the venue. Almost every hotel in the area offers complementary shuttles to/from O'Hare.

# Train / Bus From Out of Town
As an uncited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_passenger_rail_in_Chicago&oldid=621520361">sentence</a> on Wikipedia says, "During the heyday of rail transportation in the first half of the 20th century, Chicago reigned as the undisputed railroad center of the United States". Needless to say, public transportation from anywhere in the country to Chicago is still possible.

See <a href="//www.amtrak.com">Amtrak</a> for a comfortable ride that may include dining cars, <a href="//www.texaseagle.com/lounge.htm">sight-seeing</a> cars, and friendly conductors who wake you up when you've reached your destination. All Amtrak trains go to the Chicago Union Station, a scenic building itself. To use free airport shuttles offered by many hotels, take the Blue Line train (directions <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EUAfG">here</a>) to O'Hare.

Coming from Toledo, the most economical way to travel is either <a href="//us.megabus.com/">Megabus</a> or <a href="//www.greyhound.com">Greyhound</a>. To use free airport shuttles from O'Hare, the Blue Line trains can be taken from either the Megabus <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SnvXC">dropoff location</a> or from the Greyhound <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/58pGT">Station</a>.
