### Places

#### What time should I arrive?
Please try to arrive at the Fountain Blue by 4PM.

#### Is there parking at the venue?
Yes, parking is available and free for guests.

### Ceremony/Reception

#### Is there a dress code?
From the <a href="http://wedding.theknot.com/wedding-planning/attending-wedding/articles/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet.aspx">The Knot</a>'s definitions of formal attire, we are considering this a semiformal event. If you have Oscar-worthy attire, feel free to bring something more comfortable (although we ask that guests refrain from jeans or white wedding dresses).

#### Will there be an open bar?
No, but we will have a cash bar available.

#### What do the food options entail?
All food options all come with the following three courses:

- Minestrone soup
- Chef's tossed salad with choice of salad dressings
- Two flavors of wedding cake

The three entrees contain:
<ul>
	<li><b style="font-weight: bold">Chicken Breast De Jonge</b><br/>
	Saut√©ed Chicken Breast Topped with Garlic Butter Streusel Caper Cream Sauce; Fresh Green Beans, Duchess Potatoes</li>
	<li><b style="font-weight: bold">Mediterranean Purse (Vegetarian)</b><br/>
	Filo Pastry with Portobello Mushrooms, Peppers, Zucchini, Asparagus, Asiago Cheese, Cous Cous, Roasted Garlic and Herbs, Served over Fire Roasted Pepper Sauce</li>
	<li><b style="font-weight: bold">Kid's Option</b><br/>
	Chicken tenders with Fries. We don't have a detailed description, but the venue recommends this for kids aged 12 and under.</li>
</ul>


#### Can you accommodate Dairy-free / Nut-free / Kosher /&hellip; dietary restrictions?
We'll try! If you need to avoid foods, the venue has given us the impression that they are flexible if given notice. If you need seperately cooked foods (i.e., Kosher or Halal), we'll work with you and our venue. Either way, we just need to be informed as soon as possible.

Note that there will be no beef or pork served with other dinner option.
